doctype html

//
  Site's fast, eh? I've been generated by pug (https://pugjs.org/), 
  and all of my required styles are inlined. I'm hosted on Github Pages --
  its really great at hosting static pages.

  I also work with JS disabled, the only caveat of that is my webfont
  loading won't be as smooth as it is with JS enabled. You may experience my
  text flash briefly while the webfont fully downloads.

  The base stylesheet I'm using is Skeleton (https://getskeleton.com) - it
  provides a really slick grid and is otherwise fairly minimal.

  You probably don't need me to explain this all for you though.
  My sourcecode is on Github: https://github.com/maxpowa/me
